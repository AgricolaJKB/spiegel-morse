# Der SPIEGEL morst // The SPIEGEL in Morse code

### [>>> Website](https://agricolajkb.github.io/spiegel-morse)

In the 19th century, the first news agencies evolved around telegraphing news around the globe. Instead of bits and bytes, they used Morse code to transmit their messages.

What if the headlines of our times were still delivered as Morse code?

This web project regularly scrapes the the top headlines of one of Germany's major news websites, [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de), and displays them as if they were received on a wire.
